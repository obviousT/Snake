    <h3 id="top">Snake Game with Difficulty Levels and Enhanced Features</h3>
    <p>
        This project is a modern take on the classic Snake game, implemented in JavaScript and HTML5. The game includes various features and enhancements to provide a more engaging and dynamic gameplay experience.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 600;">Features:-</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Difficulty Levels:</strong><br>
        Players can select the difficulty level using a slider. The difficulty level affects the speed of the snake, making the game more challenging as the level increases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Dynamic Speed Adjustment:</strong><br>
        The speed of the game dynamically adjusts based on the selected difficulty level. This allows for a customizable and scalable challenge, ensuring that both beginners and experienced players can enjoy the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Pause Functionality:</strong><br>
        The game can be paused and resumed using the spacebar. When paused, the game and background music stop, allowing players to take breaks without losing progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>High Score Tracking:</strong><br>
        The game tracks the highest score achieved during play and saves it in the browser's local storage. This high score is displayed on the screen and is updated whenever a new high score is achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Responsive Design:</strong><br>
        The game board and elements are designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices and screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sound Effects and Background Music:</strong><br>
        The game includes sound effects for actions such as eating food and game over. Additionally, there is background music that loops during gameplay, enhancing the overall experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Food Placement Logic:</strong><br>
        The food is placed randomly on the board, but never on the snake's body. This ensures that the game remains fair and challenging.
    </p>
